# VQA-Visual-Question-Answering-Challenge

Our project is about VQA (Visual Question Answering) 2017 Challenge (http://visualqa.org/index.html). Given an image and a natural language question about the image, the task is to provide an accurate natural language answer. Visual questions selectively target different areas of an image, including background details and underlying context. 

You can find the detail in Visual-Question-Answering report.pdf
